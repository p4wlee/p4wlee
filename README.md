# 💫 About Me:
About Me<br>My name is Davide Paulicelli, and I’m turning my passion for logic and technology into a career as a Backend Web Developer.<br>After several years working in retail, where I learned to manage people, processes, and customers with precision and responsibility, I decided to take a new direction — into web development, a field that lets me combine problem-solving skills with a practical mindset.<br><br>What I’m Building Now<br>I’m currently studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and focusing on backend development with Node.js and MySQL.<br>I love understanding how things work behind the scenes and building efficient, scalable, and clean solutions.<br>To me, a good developer doesn’t just write code — they create value for people, teams, and projects.<br><br>What Sets Me Apart<br>My previous experience taught me more than it might seem:<br>-Organization and reliability, to handle complex workflows (whether it’s products or code, the principle is the same);<br>-Practical problem solving, to find real, fast solutions when things don’t go as planned;<br>-Communication and teamwork, skills I bring with me into tech, where collaboration makes the difference.<br><br>My Goals<br>I aim to grow as a Backend Developer and work with teams that share my drive to learn, experiment, and improve every day.<br>I’m curious, determined, and always open to new challenges — every line of code is a step forward in building my professional future.
